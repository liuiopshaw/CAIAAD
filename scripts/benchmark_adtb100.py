"""
ADTB-100 blind benchmark evaluation.

Feeds the 100 compounds from benchmark/AD-TxBench-100_v3.0.json
to the Nano-Bio agent ensemble WITHOUT revealing Category / Label / any preset score
(blind protocol). Each batch is scored by domain agents:

  delivery -> Efficacy (1-10)
  mechanism -> Mechanism_score (1-10)
  safety -> Safety_score (1-10) + BBB_score (1-10, CNS delivery)
  ranker  -> Clinical_score (1-10) + Overall_score (1-10), given the subscores above

Raw agent outputs are saved unmodified (project iron rule); parsed scores go to
adtb100_scores_<TS>.json in the same run dir. Compare against ground truth with
scripts/compare_adtb100.py.

Requires llava_server.py running on localhost:8000.

Usage: python scripts/benchmark_adtb100.py [--batch-size 20] [--only delivery,mechanism,safety,ranker]
